<!--
    Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other types of media. For
    example, in newspapers, large headings are typically used to capture a
    reader's attention. Other times, headings are used to describe content, like
    the title of a movie or an educational article.

    HTML follows a similar pattern. In HTML, there are six different headings, or
    heading elements. Headings can be used for a variety of purposes, like titling
    sections, articles, or other forms of content.

    The following is the list of heading elements available in HTML. They are
    ordered from largest to smallest in size.

    <h1> â€” used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for
    subheadings.
    <h2>
    <h3>
    <h4>
    <h5>
    <h6>

    The following example code uses a headline intended to capture a reader's
    attention. It uses the largest heading available, the main heading element:

    <h1>BREAKING NEWS</h1>

    Now that you know how to structure HTML elements, we'll spend the rest of the
    lesson building an informational website using some of the most common HTML
    elements. We've put some elements in to get you started, but you'll write the
    rest of the page on your own.

    Below the <h3> heading that says Features, add an <h2> heading that says
    Habitat.

    2.

    Below the Habitat heading, add an <h3> heading that says Countries with
    Large Brown Bear Populations.

    3.

    On the next line, add one more <h3> heading that says Countries with Small
    Brown Bear Populations.

    4.

    Finally, on the next line add an <h2> heading that says Media.
