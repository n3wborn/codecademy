/*
 * We've completed our extensive tour of the colors in CSS! Let's review the key
 * information we've learned.
 *
 * There are four ways to represent color in CSS:
 *
 *  Named colors â€” there are 147 named colors, which you can review here.
 *
 *  Hexadecimal or hex colors
 *
 *      Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed
 *      by "A" to "F".
 *
 *      Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green
 *      using hexademical numbers such as #23F41A.
 *
 *  RGB
 *
 *      RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for
 *      blue and one value for green.
 *
 *      RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).
 *
 *  HSL
 *
 *      HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the
 *      color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
 *
 *      Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both
 *      represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).
 *
 *  You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a,
 *  which is represented as a percentage.
