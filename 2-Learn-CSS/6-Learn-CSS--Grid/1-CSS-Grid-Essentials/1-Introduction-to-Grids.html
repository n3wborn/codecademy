    Using CSS, you can elegantly lay out elements on a web page. There is no
    simple answer for how best to do this â€” depending on what content you are
    trying to display, multiple different techniques can work well. Codecademy's
    lessons on the box model, Flexbox, and CSS display and positioning
    properties explain three possible ways to approach layout.

    In this lesson, we introduce a new, powerful tool called CSS Grid. The grid
    can be used to lay out entire web pages. Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful
    for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, CSS grid is most useful
    for two-dimensional layouts, providing many tools for aligning and moving
    elements across both rows and columns.

    By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to use these properties
    to create grid layouts:

        grid-template-columns
        grid-template-rows
        grid-template
        grid-template-area
        grid-gap
        grid-row-start / grid-row-end
        grid-column-start / grid-column-end
        grid-area

    That's a lot to learn. But by the end, you'll be a master at grid
    positioning. Let's start learning!

    Note: CSS Grid is supported in the most recent versions of many browsers,
    but it is not supported universally. To make sure that you can get the most
    out of this course, check your browser version and see if it supports CSS
    Grid. If CSS Grid is not supported in your browser, you should switch or
    update to a supported browser and version.
