<!--

    in this lesson, we have learned how to define a grid container. when
    explicitly defining a grid, you have to declare the quantity of rows and
    columns and their respective sizes.

    in all of our examples, the items placed in the grid have always taken up
    exactly one square. this does not always need to be the case; we can
    drastically change the look of our grid by making grid items take up more
    than one row and one column. you can see this in the diagram to the right.
    items a, b, c, and e span more than one row!

    in the following exercises, you will learn css properties that will affect
    the size of the grid items and where they are displayed on the page. by
    manipulating both the parent and the child elements, we can create beautiful
    layouts with ease.

    letâ€™s start exploring grid items!
